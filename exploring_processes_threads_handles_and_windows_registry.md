# 3.2.11 Lab - Exploring Processes, Threads, Handles, and Windows Registry

## Process Explorer 

It is a program that displays a list of currently running processes. As an example I used DuckDuckGO and found the process using the "Find Windows Processes -tool" highlighted as red. After selecting the tool you can click whichever application/windows you want and the chosen process is displayed.

Clicking riht mouse on the wanted process allows you to kill the process
